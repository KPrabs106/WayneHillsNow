<h2>Ways to Run App</h2>
<h3>On a real device (Recommended)</h3>
NOTE: Your device must be running Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) or higher!
<ol>
<li>Unzip the files, using an unzipping utility, such as WinZip, WinRar, or 7Zip, into a directory of your choosing.</li>
<li>Find WayneHillsNow.apk and transfer it to your device.</li>
<li>Open the file on your device, and install it. NOTE: Installing applications from unknown sources must be checked in your settings.</li>
<li>Open the app to run it.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using an emulator</h3>
NOTE: You must use an emulator running Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) or higher!
<ol>
<li>Unzip the files, using an unzipping utility, such as WinZip, WinRar, or 7Zip, into a directory of your choosing.</li>
<li>Open Android Studio and in the top left corner, click on File, and then Import Project.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where you unzipped the files. Find the build.gradle file and double click it in the window.</li>
<li>Run the app on an emulator with Android 4.3 or higher.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app communicates with our server, an Amazon EC2 Cloud Computing server, which is at <a href="http://54.164.136.46">http://54.164.136.46</a>.</li>
<li>Log in to Google+ in order to get the maximum functionality of the application. Without logging in to Google+, you will not be able to use the attend event feature.</li>
<li>Running on the emulator is typically slower than on an actual device, depending on the specs of the machine running the emulator.</li>
<li>Certain features on the emulator do not work, such as clicking on an email address contact. On a real device, clicking an email address will result in the opening of the default email application.</li>
<li>Networking processes are typically slower on the emulator. This can be seen by the loading spinners on images.</li>
</ul>
